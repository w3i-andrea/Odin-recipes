        <h2>Description:</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>We clean the guanciale by removing the rind, then cut it into strips of about 1 cm each.</li>
                <li>We put the guanciale in a pan, possibly an iron one, together with a little oil and brown over low heat for 7-8 minutes, until it has become crunchy but transparent.</li>
                <li>Once the guanciale has been browned well, add the chilli pepper and then add the white wine.</li>
                <li>Add the tomato and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Let the sauce cook over a moderate heat, then add the pecorino and mix a little. Let everything mix, then turn off the heat.</li>
                <li>Drain the spaghetti al dente, then add it to the sauce.</li>
            </ol>
