                <li>320g pasta</li>
                <li>150g basil</li>
                <li>40g grated parmesan</li>
                <li>25g pine nuts</li>
                <li>extra vergin olive oil</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To prepare the pasta with pesto, immediately heat the water to cook the pasta.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, wash and dry the basil well with a clean cloth.</li>
                <li>We put the basil in the blender bowl, add the oil, salt, garlic and pine nuts.</li>
                <li>Blend intermittently for a few seconds. This way the pesto will not heat up too much, maintaining its bright green color.</li>
                <li>We then add the grated cheese and blend again intermittently until we obtain the right consistency.</li>
                <li>Drain the pasta al dente and season it with plenty of pesto. Our pesto pasta is ready! Sprinkle it with grated cheese and decorate with two basil leaves before serving.</li>
