        <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>Tagliatelle with ragù are one of the most loved first courses in Italian cuisine. Widespread throughout the country and traditionally associated with Emilia-Romagna and the city of Bologna.</p>
            <p>To make tagliatelle al ragù we need some time, because the sauce needs to cook for a couple of hours. But the ragù sauce recipe is still very easy and within everyone's reach.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>250g tagliatelle</li>
                <li>150g bacon</li>
                <li>500g ground beef</li>
                <li>200ml red wine</li>
                <li>400ml tomato sauce</li>
                <li>200ml milk</li>
                <li>a celery stalk</li>
                <li>a carrot</li>
                <li>an onion</li>
                <li>extra vergin olive oil</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>pepper</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First, brown the bacon alone in a pan for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Add a little oil, the chopped celery, onion and carrot and fry.</li>
                <li>When the vegetables have wilted, add the minced meat and brown for 5 minutes. Then we add the red wine and continue cooking for another 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>We also pour the tomato puree into the pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook the ragù over a very low heat with the lid on for an hour and a half.</li>
                <li>Add the milk, mix and continue cooking for another 5 minutes, or even 10 if needed.</li>
                <li>When the ragù is ready, creamy and homogeneous, boil the tagliatelle in boiling salted water, then drain them and put them in the pot with the ragù.</li>
                <li>Let's plate and serve our tagliatelle with ragù nice and hot!</li>
